Context:
To correctly implement the multi-client, multi-site, and multi-sensor functionality, the client has provided two new XML files. These XMLs each represent a site containing multiple sensors (probes).

Our system must be updated to:

Parse and import data from the new XML structure.
Ensure each sensor is correctly linked to its site and customer.
Modify the database structure if needed to accommodate this format.
Allow users to navigate between different sites and sensors via a dashboard menu.
üîπ Required Enhancements:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Update XML Parsing to Handle Multi-Sensor Site Files

Adapt the existing XML parsing logic to support multiple sensors within each site file.
Extract the following key elements from the XML:
Customer ID (CustomerID)
Site ID (SiteID)
Probe ID (Address, unique per sensor)
Timestamp (DateTime)
Measurement Data (Product, Water, Density, Temperatures, etc.)
Ensure the system correctly tags each sensor with its respective site and customer.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Modify Database Logic (if needed) to Support Multi-Site, Multi-Sensor Hierarchy

Update database schema to properly store:
customers ‚Üí Customer ID, name.
sites ‚Üí Site ID, Customer ID (FK), name.
probes ‚Üí Probe ID, Site ID (FK), unique address.
measurements ‚Üí Measurement ID, Probe ID (FK), timestamp, recorded values.
Ensure historical data is stored per probe to allow time-based tracking.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Develop a Site & Sensor Selection UI in the Sidebar

The sidebar menu should allow users to:
View all sites assigned to their customer ID.
Expand each site to see the list of probes (sensors) within it.
Click on a probe to load its detailed dashboard.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Implement a Summary Dashboard as the Default View

Instead of opening a single probe‚Äôs dashboard on startup, the main screen should:
Display a summary of all probes for the selected site.
Show three key data points per probe, such as:
Status (OK, Acknowledged, Alarm)
Last recorded measurement
Main measurement value (e.g., product level in tank)
This screen should allow users to quickly select a probe for detailed analysis.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Validation

Validate the new XML format before processing to prevent import errors.
Implement error handling for missing or invalid data.
